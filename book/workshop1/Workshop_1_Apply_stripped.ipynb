For this model you need to obtain $\\mathbf{K}$ and $\\mathbf{f}$ of all elements and add them to the correct locations in the global stiffness matrix and force vector. To do that, make use of the `global_dofs` function of the Element class and the `np.ix_` Numpy utility function. (Tip: refer back to what you did in the `constrain` function).\n",
